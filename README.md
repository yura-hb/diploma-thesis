To perform any of the experiments you must define the configuration file following examples in `configuration/experiments` folders.
Then to execute the experiment just call `cli.py`, i.e.

```
python cli.py --configuration PATH_TO_EXPERIMENT_FILE
```

The requirements of the work are present in `requirements.txt`.
